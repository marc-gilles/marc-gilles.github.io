	abstract = {Smell is a sensory modality that is rarely considered in birds, but evidence is mounting that olfaction is an important aspect of avian behaviour and ecology. The uropygial gland produces an odoriferous secretion (preen oil) that can differ seasonally and between the sexes. These differences are hypothesized to function in olfactory camouflage, i.e. minimizing detection by nest predators (olfactory crypsis hypothesis), and/or intraspecific olfactory communication, particularly during breeding (sex semiochemical hypothesis). However, evidence for seasonal and sex differences in preen oil is mixed, with some studies finding differences and others not, and direct evidence for the putative function(s) of seasonal variation and sex differences in preen oil remains limited. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for such changes in preen oil chemical composition, finding seasonal differences in 95\% of species (57/60 species in 35 studies) and sex differences in 47\% of species (28/59 species in 46 studies). We then conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses using data from 59 bird species to evaluate evidence for both the olfactory crypsis and sex semiochemical hypotheses. Seasonal differences were more likely in the incubating than non-incubating sex in ground-nesting species, but were equally likely regardless of incubation strategy in non-ground-nesting species. This result supports the olfactory crypsis hypothesis, if ground nesters are more vulnerable to olfactorily searching predators than non-ground nesters. Sex differences were more likely in species with uniparental than biparental incubation and during breeding than non-breeding, consistent with both the olfactory crypsis and sex semiochemical hypotheses. At present, the data do not allow us to disentangle these two hypotheses, but we provide recommendations that will enable researchers to do so.},

	abstract = {Preen oil, the secretion of the uropygial gland, may be an important source of body odour in birds. By characterizing the chemical composition of preen oil, we can describe the olfactory phenotypes of birds and investigate whether odours could have a function in sexual signalling or other chemical communication. Here we analysed the preen oil of a wild passerine, the European Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, to find out whether it holds socially relevant information. We sampled both the female and male of breeding pairs during nestling rearing to test for sex differences and within-pair similarity. We additionally sampled the females during incubation to test for changes across breeding stages and for individual repeatability of chemical profiles. Pair mates had similar chemical profiles in comparison with other breeding adults. Furthermore, we found evidence for sex differences and for changes across breeding stages. Notably, the preen oil of females was more diverse and more volatile than that of males, and the preen oil secreted by females during incubation was more volatile than that secreted during nestling rearing. However, we found no evidence for individual repeatability of chemical profiles across breeding stages in females. Our results point towards a function of preen oil in sexual signalling, although other functions should not be excluded. Our study is a first step towards understanding the role of odours in the social life of an important avian model species used in the study of mate choice and sexual selection.},

	abstract = {In many taxa, young can recognize their parents using olfactory cues. Yet this possibility has been overlooked in birds, because they were long assumed to have a poor sense of smell. While evidence is growing that birds use odours to communicate, olfactory parent recognition has only been documented in two altricial bird species. Whether chicks of precocial species use olfaction to recognize parents is currently unknown. Parent recognition is particularly important in precocial species, as chicks leave the nest shortly after hatching, and may lose contact with their parents and encounter other conspecific adults. We conducted Y-maze trials in the wild to test whether chicks of a precocial shorebird, the white-fronted plover, Anarhynchus marginatus, can recognize parents via olfaction. We tested first whether chicks show a preference for the odour (preen oil) of an unfamiliar adult over a control (no odour), and second whether chicks show a preference for the odour of a parent over that of an unfamiliar adult. Plover chicks spent as much time with the odour of an unfamiliar adult as with the control, and as much time with the odour of a parent as with that of an unfamiliar adult. Therefore, we found no evidence that chicks react to the preen oil odour of a conspecific adult, nor that they can discriminate a parent using preen oil odours. It may be that chicks of this species can discriminate parental and foreign odours but that our experiment failed to detect it, that they rely on other (e.g. auditory) cues, or that they do not need to discriminate between parents and foreign conspecific adults.},

	abstract = {Preen oil, the secretion from the uropygial gland of birds, may have a specific function in incubation. Consistent with this, during incubation, the chemical composition of preen oil is more likely to differ between sexes in species where only one sex incubates than in species where both sexes incubate. In this study, we tested the generality of this apparent difference, by investigating sex differences in the preen oil composition of a shorebird species, the Kentish plover (Anarhynchus, formerly Charadrius, alexandrinus). As both sexes incubate in this species, we predicted the absence of sex differences in preen oil composition during incubation. In the field, we sampled preen oil from nine females and 11 males during incubation, which we analysed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Consistent with predictions, we found no sex difference in preen oil composition, neither in beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) nor in alpha diversity (Shannon index and number of substances). Based on these results, we cannot conclude whether preen oil has a function during incubation in Kentish plovers. Still, we discuss hypothetical roles, such as olfactory crypsis, protection against ectoparasites or olfactory intraspecific communication, which remain to be tested.},

	abstract = {Preen oil ? the secretion from the uropygial gland of birds ? may have diverse functions in avian reproduction: protection against eggshell bacteria, olfactory crypsis against nest predators and olfactory mate choice. To investigate such functions, we should first characterise variation in preen oil composition, but also confirm that previously described patterns are robust. Replication studies are crucial to test the reproducibility of previous findings, but are rarely undertaken in chemical ecology. Here, we conducted an almost exact replication of a previous study on the chemical composition of preen oil in a wild passerine bird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. We aimed to estimate the reproducibility of the previous results using larger sample sizes and following a pre-registered analysis. In addition, we explored the ontogeny of preen oil composition by comparing nestling and adult preen oil. In line with previous findings, preen oil composition was similar between breeding partners and not repeatable within individual females across breeding stages. Female preen oil changed across breeding stages more clearly than in the original study (higher richness, diversity and volatility during incubation than nestling-rearing), further refuting a role of preen oil in olfactory crypsis in this species. Unlike the original study, we found no difference in chemical profiles between sexes (nestling-rearing), casting doubt on the proposed role of preen oil as a sex semiochemical in this species. Nestling preen oil differed from adults, was more similar to adult males than to adult females, but was not more similar to parents than to non-parents. We found family chemical signatures, which, along with the breeding pair signature, suggests an influence of the nest environment on preen oil composition. Our study highlights the importance of replication and provides novel insights into the function and development of preen oil.},
