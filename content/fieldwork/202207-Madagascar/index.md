Behavioural experiments and observations & sampling of odour and microbiota

<!--more-->

In 2021 and 2022, I designed and conducted behavioural experiments to test olfactory communication in white-fronted plovers in Andavadoaka, Madagascar. Besides, we collected samples of preen oil, odour, gut microbiota, and measured the size of the preen gland in the three plover species breeding on the study site (white-fronted, Kittlitz's and Madagascar plovers). We also continued the breeding monitoring and applied a protocol to describe their mating system (courtship, incubation, parental care). The fieldwork was conducted with Tafita Mijoro, Hugo Eira Pereira, William Jones and local field assistants, lead by Sama Zefania (University of Toliara & Morondava) and supervised by Tamás Székely (University of Debrecen & Bath).
