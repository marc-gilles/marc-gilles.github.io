Effect of urbanisation on scent, physiology, size and colouration.

<!--more-->

First time that I study a non-avian species! 

I assisted Isabel Dam√°s-Moreira on her fieldwork in Rovinj and Pula, Croatia. We captured, sampled and measured hundreds of wall lizards (*Podarcis muralis*) from urban and wild locations. The aim of the study is to asses the adaptation of these lizards to urban environments.

- Feces and scent samples
- Morphometric measurements
- Photography for colouration measurements
