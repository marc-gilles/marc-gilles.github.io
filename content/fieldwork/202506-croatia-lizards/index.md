Effect of urbanisation on the morphology and behaviour of wall lizards.

<!--more-->

First time that I study a non-avian species! 

I joined Isabel Dam√°s-Moreira on her fieldwork in Rovinj and Pula, Croatia. We captured, sampled and measured hundreds of wall lizards (*Podarcis muralis*) from urban and wild locations. The aim is to asses the adaptation of these lizards to urban environments.
