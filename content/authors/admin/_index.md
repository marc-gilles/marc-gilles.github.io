#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep #learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s #architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This #is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the #functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a behavioural and chemical ecologist with a particular interest in chemical communication in birds. My research combines chemical analyses, multivariate statistics and behavioural experiments to investigate whether and how birds use odours in various contexts, including mate choice, parent-offspring recognition, camouflage, and predator deterrence.

**I am currently searching for a postdoc position and for a host to apply for third-party funding!**
