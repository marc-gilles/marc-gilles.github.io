During the conference Behaviour 2023 organised in Bielefeld, we conducted a study on Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI). This important work was lead by Rebecca Chen and many colleagues contributed, and is now out in Ecology & Evolution.

We found that women are less likely to ask questions than men, and that this was because they raised their hands less than men, and not because they were less likely to be chosen by the session host. In an experiment, we found that prioritising women to ask questions at to start the Q&A did not affect the likelihood of women raising their hand. With questionnaires, we identified barriers for equity and inclusivity and propose ideas to make scientifc conferences more inclusive.
