abstract: In many taxa, young can recognize their parents using olfactory cues. Yet
  this possibility has been overlooked in birds, because they were long assumed to
  have a poor sense of smell. While evidence is growing that birds use odours to communicate,
  olfactory parent recognition has only been documented in two altricial bird species.
  Whether chicks of precocial species use olfaction to recognize parents is currently
  unknown. Parent recognition is particularly important in precocial species, as chicks
  leave the nest shortly after hatching, and may lose contact with their parents and
  encounter other conspecific adults. We conducted Y-maze trials in the wild to test
  whether chicks of a precocial shorebird, the white-fronted plover, Anarhynchus marginatus,
  can recognize parents via olfaction. We tested first whether chicks show a preference
  for the odour (preen oil) of an unfamiliar adult over a control (no odour), and
  second whether chicks show a preference for the odour of a parent over that of an
  unfamiliar adult. Plover chicks spent as much time with the odour of an unfamiliar
  adult as with the control, and as much time with the odour of a parent as with that
  of an unfamiliar adult. Therefore, we found no evidence that chicks react to the
  preen oil odour of a conspecific adult, nor that they can discriminate a parent
  using preen oil odours. It may be that chicks of this species can discriminate parental
  and foreign odours but that our experiment failed to detect it, that they rely on
  other (e.g. auditory) cues, or that they do not need to discriminate between parents
  and foreign conspecific adults.
