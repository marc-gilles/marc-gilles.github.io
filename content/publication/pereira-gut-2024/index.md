abstract: 'Evolutionary divergence and genetic variation are often linked to differences
  in microbial community structure and diversity. While environmental factors and
  diet heavily influence gut microbial communities, host species contributions are
  harder to quantify. Closely related species living in sympatry provide a unique
  opportunity to investigate species differences without the confounding effects of
  habitat and dietary variation. We therefore compared and contrasted the gut microbiota
  of three sympatric plover species: the widespread Kittlitz’s and white-fronted plovers
  (Anarhynchus pecuarius and A. marginatus) and the endemic and vulnerable Madagascar
  plover (A. thoracicus).'
