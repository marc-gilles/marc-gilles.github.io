abstract: Preen oil, the secretion from the uropygial gland of birds, may have a specific
  function in incubation. Consistent with this, during incubation, the chemical composition
  of preen oil is more likely to differ between sexes in species where only one sex
  incubates than in species where both sexes incubate. In this study, we tested the
  generality of this apparent difference, by investigating sex differences in the
  preen oil composition of a shorebird species, the Kentish plover (Anarhynchus, formerly
  Charadrius, alexandrinus). As both sexes incubate in this species, we predicted
  the absence of sex differences in preen oil composition during incubation. In the
  field, we sampled preen oil from nine females and 11 males during incubation, which
  we analysed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Consistent with predictions,
  we found no sex difference in preen oil composition, neither in beta diversity (Bray-Curtis
  dissimilarities) nor in alpha diversity (Shannon index and number of substances).
  Based on these results, we cannot conclude whether preen oil has a function during
  incubation in Kentish plovers. Still, we discuss hypothetical roles, such as olfactory
  crypsis, protection against ectoparasites or olfactory intraspecific communication,
  which remain to be tested.
